How to run:

Two ways: 1 just put all the files into a directory and then follow the steps. 2 clone the github repository to a folder and then follow the steps.

github link: https://github.com/SpencerPresley/COSC330/tree/main/Lab1_TicTacToe

1) Ensure the directory is named 'Lab1_TicTacToe'
    if it isn't do the following in your terminal (must be in directory with this folder in it)
    mv {currentDirectoryName} Lab1_TicTacToe

2) Compilation:
    Open your terminal/ command prompt
    Navigate to the parent directory of Lab1_TicTacToe, if you're coming from step one you should already be here but if not you need to move there via the cd command
    Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
        javac Lab1_TicTacToe/*.java

3) Running the game:
    Run the following command from the parent directory of Lab1_TicTacToe:
        java -cp . Lab1_TicTacToe.Main

Have fun!
