To compile and run follow these steps

Add the Lab1-TicTacToe directory to a directory you'd like to work from (clone it into that directory)

Via the terminal navigate into the ToeTacTic directory

Run the following on the command line in order to compile the java files:
javac *.java

Go up one directory via (this would be back to the directory that you cloned this directory into, so if you clone Lab1-TicTacToe into a directory named COSC330 you should be in COSC330):
cd ..

Run the following on the command line:
java -cp . Lab1-TicTacToe.Main

Have fun!
